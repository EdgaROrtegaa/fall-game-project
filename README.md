-the control are just left arrow and right arrow 

# the problems i faced while making this game 
-was choosing over shooting my expection in make the game at the start. I started making a platformer at first but i quickly desided to make this fall game because it was simple for its design and just a simple game in general. I wanted to add music to the game while you play and special sound effects plays while you fall through the holes, Then to add a 2 player mode where you can head to head with an other person and only one player can pass through the hole at a time to make it more competitive. To add on that i wanted to make the game move faster then it is right now that which i was able to, but not fast enough to keep the player/user enganged in the game .
